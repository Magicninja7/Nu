  - RESEARCH
  - approx. 10 hours
i mainly use reprap forum, yt videos about mechanical features, learning about advantages of certain designs over other (ex ball screw, vs normal, or belt vs gears)
i also am actively analysing every word in this excellent guide: [drdflo](https://www.drdflo.com/pages/Guides/How-to-Build-a-3D-Printer/FFF.html). 
I have finalised all design, choices, drew some more complex ones on paper, and am starting to create a BOM.
Basically:
 - circular heated printbed 200mm in diamater
 - 220mm, 10mm [sliding rods for printbed](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33036180370.html)
