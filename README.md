  - Today i have visualised basic mechanics
  - RESEARCH 
i mainly use reprap forum, yt videos about mechanical features, learning about advantages of certain designs over other (ex ball screw, vs normal, or belt vs gears)
i also am actively analysing every word in this excellent guide: [drdflo](https://www.drdflo.com/pages/Guides/How-to-Build-a-3D-Printer/FFF.html). I often use search in chatgpt to clarify concepts. The last 3 hours were spent analysing, and trying to think of a design on my blackboard.
