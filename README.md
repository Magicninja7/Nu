Nu, a 5-axis 3d printer

# Project specifics
 - no set largness yet
 - circular printbed + cantilevered design
 - 5 axis:
   - c axis of printbed
   - x, y, z axis of cantilever
   - b axis of nozzle

# Goals
 - actually create it
 - make it fairly around the 300$ mark
 - make the firmware work (reprap)

# Todo
- todo

  - Today i have visualised basic mechanics
 
Since its a polar 3d printer, it has a rotating base. and i need to put cabels toward the heated printbed. I considered 3 different solutions. a. use a motor with hollow rod -> although no wear and tear like in next ideas, it requires custom parts. b. a belt, this i dismissed due to lack of control over the printbed, and i dont want to take that risk. c. gears! i will put 2 gears, 1 connected to bed, other to motor (dont know the specific teeth yet). This will allow printbed to rotate, while allowing cables through, and keeping smooth moving thanks to a central bearing.
For z axis ill use 1-2 screws (prob 2), and for y axis, ill use a set of rails (on the bottom), and a screw. 
im still refining and rethingking the design here, but:
for x axis, ie the one holding the nozzle will probably be moved using a set of gears, or belts, im still thinking.
last but not least, the b axis, it will be moved using a belt. It most likely will be on the outside facing side, being controled by a servo. 
this has been what ive been visualising, but ill still need to verify everyting, so it works correctly.
